A GatsbyJS (ReactJS) project built to be a personal portfolio/dev blog using Drupal 8's JSONAPI for some GraphQL and RESTful servives.

This project is also currently being used for my own personal education in different development processes and technologies (eg. CI/CD tools, component-based architecture, ES6, etc.). As such, it is constantly changing which correlates to some instability.

## Production Environments

If you'd like to visit the production deployments, follow the respective links below.

- [Drupal 8 website](https://api.gavinvaught.com)

*If you're curious to see the DrupalAPI endpoint, simply append `/api` to the Drupal 8 website's URL.*

## Â¡AVISO!

**You probably shouldn't use this repo as a template or basis for any other projects.**

I do plan to publish a basic distro for a scalable component-based DrupalAPI/Gatsby project once I hit a *stable* milestone that I'm happy with.
