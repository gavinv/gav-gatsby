## What

This project consists a living website built primarily in [React](https://reactjs.org) with [Gatsby.js](https://gatsby.org) as a framework to provide static html files, caching, SEO (React Helmet), and other various optimizations out-of-the-box.  This also allows for easy deployment to [Netlify's](https://netlify.com) CDN as the builds are triggered from Production branch commit hooks and hosting is free for "static" webpages and webapps.

Along with the fully custom React components and some Gatsby.js configurations, this project includes basic [Gitlab CI](https://gitlab.com/ci) integration and [serverless functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions).

## Why

Learning, of course!  While the main end-goal for the development of this project is to be used as a personal portfolio website, it doubles as a canvas for me to experiment with and continually grow as a web engineer.
